# Product Requirements Document: MCP-Orchestrated AI Travel Agent

**Main Takeaway:**  
Build an intelligent AI travel agent that uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools to orchestrate itinerary generation. An AI agent (Claude/GPT-4) makes contextual decisions about which tools to invoke, how to interpret user preferences, and how to synthesize information from OpenStreetMap, Wikipedia, and DuckDuckGo into personalized travel recommendations. Focus on the 20% of agent orchestration features that deliver 80% of learning value.

## 1. Objective and Scope  

Deliver a **proof-of-concept MCP agent system** that demonstrates intelligent tool orchestration for travel planning. Unlike traditional web applications with predetermined workflows, this system features an AI agent that makes dynamic decisions about which MCP tools to invoke based on natural language user requests.

**Core Learning Objectives:**
- **Agent Decision Making:** How AI agents choose which tools to use based on context
- **Multi-Step Reasoning:** How agents chain tool calls together intelligently  
- **Error Recovery:** How agents handle failed API calls or adapt when tools return poor results
- **Natural Language Processing:** How agents interpret user intent and generate contextual responses

**MCP Tools to Build:**
- `geocode_tool` - wraps OSM Nominatim for location resolution
- `poi_search_tool` - wraps Overpass API for point-of-interest discovery
- `wikipedia_lookup_tool` - wraps Wikipedia APIs for detailed descriptions
- `trivia_search_tool` - wraps DuckDuckGo API for interesting facts

## 2. User Stories (Natural Language Interaction)

1. **As a history enthusiast**, I say "Plan a historical walking tour of Rome" and receive POIs focused on ancient sites with rich historical context.
2. **As a food lover**, I request "Show me the best local food experiences in Barcelona" and get restaurant recommendations with cultural background.
3. **As a family traveler**, I ask "What can we do in Paris with young children?" and receive family-friendly attractions with practical tips.
4. **As a budget traveler**, I say "Free activities in Berlin for a weekend" and get cost-conscious recommendations with insider knowledge.

    """
```

## 5. Agent Orchestration Architecture

### 5.1 Agent System Design
The core system centers around an **AI Agent Controller** that receives natural language requests and orchestrates MCP tool usage:

```python
class TravelAgent:
    def __init__(self, llm_client, mcp_tools):
        self.llm = llm_client  # Claude, GPT-4, etc.
        self.tools = mcp_tools
        self.conversation_memory = []
    
    async def process_request(self, user_request: str) -> str:
        # Agent analyzes request and decides tool usage strategy
        response = await self.llm.generate(
            system_prompt=TRAVEL_AGENT_PROMPT,
            user_input=user_request,
            tools=self.tools,
            conversation_history=self.conversation_memory
        )
        return response
```

### 5.2 Agent Decision Flow
1. **Intent Analysis:** Agent interprets user preferences (history, food, family, budget, etc.)
2. **Tool Selection:** Agent decides which tools to invoke and in what sequence
3. **Contextual Execution:** Agent calls tools with parameters informed by user context
4. **Quality Assessment:** Agent evaluates tool results and decides whether to refine searches
5. **Synthesis:** Agent combines information into personalized, coherent recommendations
6. **Memory Update:** Agent retains context for follow-up questions

### 5.3 Example Agent Reasoning Process
**User:** "Plan a romantic evening in Paris"

**Agent Reasoning:**
- *Intent:* Romantic activities, evening timing, Paris location
- *Tool Strategy:* Geocode Paris → Search romantic venues (restaurants, viewpoints) → Get Wikipedia context for ambiance → Find romantic trivia
- *Synthesis:* Combine into evening itinerary with romantic narrative

## 6. Implementation Milestones

## 7. Success Metrics for MCP Learning

- **Agent Autonomy:** Agent successfully selects appropriate tools without hardcoded workflows in ≥90% of test cases
- **Contextual Adaptation:** Agent modifies tool usage based on user preferences (e.g., "historical" vs "family-friendly") in ≥80% of requests  
- **Error Recovery:** Agent gracefully handles tool failures and finds alternative information sources in ≥75% of error scenarios
- **Synthesis Quality:** Agent-generated responses demonstrate meaningful information fusion rather than simple concatenation
- **Learning Demonstration:** Clear evidence of MCP orchestration patterns in code architecture and agent behavior

## 8. Technical Stack (Minimal Complexity)

**Backend Framework:** FastAPI with MCP tool integration
**AI Agent:** Claude-3.5 or GPT-4 via API with function calling
**MCP Implementation:** Python MCP SDK for tool creation
**Frontend:** Simple HTML/JavaScript for agent chat interface (no complex mapping initially)
**Data Storage:** In-memory conversation state (no database required for MVP)

## 9. Key Differentiators from Traditional PRD

This MCP-based approach fundamentally differs from traditional web applications:

**Traditional Approach:** User input → Predetermined API sequence → Fixed response format
**MCP Orchestration:** User input → Agent analysis → Dynamic tool selection → Contextual synthesis → Personalized response

The agent becomes the intelligent orchestrator that makes contextual decisions, handles uncertainty, and provides natural language interaction. This design prioritizes learning agent orchestration patterns over building a polished travel application.

## 10. Future MCP Enhancements (Beyond 80/20)

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Specialized agents for different travel domains (food, culture, adventure)
- **Tool Learning:** Agents that improve tool selection based on user feedback
- **Complex Workflow Management:** Multi-day itinerary planning with dependency management
- **Integration Expansion:** Additional MCP tools for weather, transportation, booking systems

This PRD transforms the original deterministic web application into a genuine MCP learning environment where an AI agent orchestrates tool usage through intelligent decision-making, providing hands-on experience with the core patterns of agent orchestration that transfer to more sophisticated MCP applications.
