# Product Requirements Document: MCP-Orchestrated AI Travel Agent

**Main Takeaway:**  
Build an intelligent AI travel agent that uses Model Context Protocol tools to orchestrate travel itinerary generation. An AI agent (GPT-4o-mini) interprets user preferences and synthesizes information from OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia through a structured travel planning workflow using MCP protocol communication. Focus on the 20% of agent orchestration features that deliver 80% of learning value.

**Backend Framework:** FastMCP servers with MCP tool integration  
**AI Agent:** GPT-4ο-mini via API with MCP orchestration (not traditional function calling)  
**MCP Implementation:** Python MCP SDK for tool creation  
**Frontend:** Simple HTML/JavaScript for agent chat interface (no complex mapping initially)  
**Data Storage:** In-memory conversation state (no database required for MVP)

## 1. Objective and Scope  

Deliver a **proof-of-concept MCP agent system** that demonstrates intelligent tool orchestration for travel planning. Unlike traditional web applications with hardcoded API calls, this system features an AI agent that coordinates a structured travel planning workflow using MCP protocol communication to independent tool servers.

**Core Learning Objectives:**
- **MCP Protocol Communication:** How agents coordinate multiple MCP servers via protocol calls
- **Multi-Step Workflow Orchestration:** How agents chain tool calls together in logical sequences  
- **Error Recovery:** How agents handle failed API calls or adapt when tools return poor results
- **Intelligent Result Synthesis:** How agents interpret and combine data from multiple sources into coherent responses

**MCP Tools to Build:**
- `geocode_tool` - wraps OSM Nominatim for location resolution
- `poi_search_tool` - wraps Overpass API for point-of-interest discovery
- `wikipedia_lookup_tool` - wraps Wikipedia APIs for detailed descriptions

## 1.1 MCP Protocol vs Traditional Function Calling

**Critical Architecture Distinction:** This system uses **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for distributed tool orchestration, NOT traditional function calling.

**How MCP Works:**
1. **Protocol Communication:** Tools are executed via MCP protocol calls to independent servers
2. **Distributed Architecture:** Each tool runs as an independent MCP server process
3. **Structured Workflows:** The AI agent coordinates tool execution through MCP client calls
4. **Error Isolation:** Tool failures are isolated to individual MCP servers

**MCP Flow:**
```
User Query → AI Analysis → Structured MCP Tool Workflow → Result Synthesis
```

**Key Advantage:** Unlike traditional function calling where tools are embedded in the application, MCP servers provide distributed, independent tool execution with protocol-based communication.

## 2. User Stories (Natural Language Interaction)

1. **As a history enthusiast**, I say "Plan a historical walking tour of Rome" and receive POIs focused on ancient sites with rich historical context.
2. **As a food lover**, I request "Show me the best local food experiences in Barcelona" and get restaurant recommendations with cultural background.
3. **As a family traveler**, I ask "What can we do in Paris with young children?" and receive family-friendly attractions with practical tips.
4. **As a budget traveler**, I say "Free activities in Berlin for a weekend" and get cost-conscious recommendations with insider knowledge.

## 5. Agent Orchestration Architecture

### 5.1 Agent System Design
The core system centers around an **AI Agent Controller** that receives natural language requests and orchestrates a structured travel planning workflow through MCP protocol communication:

```python
class TravelAgent:
    def __init__(self, llm_client, mcp_clients):
        self.llm = llm_client  # GPT-4o-mini for analysis and synthesis
        self.mcp_clients = mcp_clients  # MCP client connections to tool servers
        self.conversation_memory = []
    
    async def process_request(self, user_request: str) -> str:
        # AI agent analyzes user intent and location
        intent_analysis = await self.llm.analyze_intent(user_request)
        
        # Execute structured travel planning workflow via MCP protocol
        workflow_results = await self.execute_travel_workflow(
            intent_analysis.location, 
            intent_analysis.preferences
        )
        
        # AI synthesizes results into personalized response
        return await self.llm.synthesize_response(
            workflow_results, 
            intent_analysis, 
            user_request
        )
    
    async def execute_travel_workflow(self, location, preferences):
        # Structured workflow: Geocode → POI Search → Wikipedia Enrichment
        coords = await self.mcp_clients.geocoding.call({"location_name": location})
        pois = await self.mcp_clients.poi.call({
            "latitude": coords["lat"], 
            "longitude": coords["lon"],
            "category": preferences.category
        })
        context = await self.mcp_clients.wikipedia.call({"poi_name": location})
        
        return {"coords": coords, "pois": pois, "context": context}
```

### 5.2 Agent Decision Flow
1. **Intent Analysis:** AI agent interprets user preferences (history, food, family, budget, etc.) and extracts location
2. **Workflow Coordination:** Agent executes structured travel planning workflow via MCP protocol calls
3. **Location Resolution:** Agent calls geocoding MCP server to resolve location to coordinates
4. **POI Discovery:** Agent calls POI MCP server with coordinates and preference-based categories
5. **Context Enrichment:** Agent calls Wikipedia MCP server to add contextual information
6. **Result Synthesis:** Agent combines MCP tool results into personalized, coherent recommendations
7. **Memory Update:** Agent retains context for follow-up questions

### 5.3 Example Agent Reasoning Process
**User:** "Plan a romantic evening in Paris"

**Agent Workflow:**
- *Intent Analysis:* Extract location "Paris" and preferences "romantic activities, evening timing"
- *MCP Workflow Execution:* 
  1. Call geocoding MCP server to resolve "Paris" coordinates
  2. Call POI MCP server with coordinates and "restaurant" + "tourism" categories for romantic venues
  3. Call Wikipedia MCP server to enrich venues with romantic context and ambiance information
- *Result Synthesis:* AI combines MCP tool outputs into evening itinerary with romantic narrative

## 9. Key Differentiators from Traditional PRD

This MCP-based approach fundamentally differs from traditional web applications:

**Traditional Function Calling:** User input → Embedded API calls → Fixed response format  
**MCP Orchestration:** User input → AI intent analysis → Structured MCP workflow → Protocol-based tool coordination → AI synthesis → Personalized response

The agent becomes the intelligent coordinator that manages a distributed travel planning workflow through MCP protocol communication, demonstrating how AI can orchestrate multiple independent services to achieve complex domain-specific goals.

## 10. Future MCP Enhancements (Beyond 80/20)

- **Adaptive Workflows:** Modify tool execution order based on user preferences and context
- **Advanced Synthesis:** More sophisticated AI-driven content generation and personalization
- **Complex Error Recovery:** Intelligent fallback strategies and alternative tool usage
- **Integration Expansion:** Additional MCP tools for weather, transportation, booking systems

This PRD creates a focused MCP learning environment where an AI agent coordinates a realistic travel planning workflow through intelligent orchestration of distributed MCP tool servers, providing hands-on experience with core MCP communication patterns that transfer to more sophisticated applications.
