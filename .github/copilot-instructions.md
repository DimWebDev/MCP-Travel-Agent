For all AI coding agents and contributors:

**Start by reading `AGENTS.md` in the project root.**

- It explains the workflow, code quality standards, contribution process, and project-specific conventions.
- Follow the step-by-step onboarding in `AGENTS.md` before referencing any other documentation.
- For requirements, architecture, and implementation details, see `PRD.md`, `Planning.md`, and `Tasks.md`.

> All essential knowledge for productive work in this codebase is maintained in `AGENTS.md`. Always consult it first.
