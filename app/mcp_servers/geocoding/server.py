"""
Geocoding MCP Server: Location Resolution via OpenStreetMap Nominatim

This module provides a specialized MCP server for converting location names
into geographic coordinates using the OpenStreetMap Nominatim geocoding service.

ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW:
-----------------------
This server acts as an intelligent data provider in the MCP-orchestrated
travel agent system. It handles the critical first step of travel planning:
resolving user-provided location names into precise coordinates that other
MCP servers can use for POI discovery, Wikipedia lookups, and trivia searches.

RATE LIMITING COMPLIANCE:
-------------------------
OpenStreetMap Nominatim requires respectful usage with a maximum of 1 request
per second per IP address. This server implements proper rate limiting to
ensure compliance and prevent service disruption.

MCP INTEGRATION:
----------------
The server exposes a single tool `geocode_location` that accepts location names
and returns structured coordinate data. The Agent Orchestrator will use this
tool when users provide location names instead of coordinates.
