## üö¶ Checking MCP Server Health with the Inspector GUI

> **Inspector for FastMCP 2.x+**
> 
> For FastMCP 2.x and later, always use `poetry run fastmcp dev ...` to launch the Inspector. The legacy `mcp dev` CLI is not compatible with FastMCP 2.x servers. The built-in Inspector provides a web-based UI for tool discovery and testing.

You can verify any FastMCP server end‚Äêto‚Äêend by using the **FastMCP Inspector**‚Äîa lightweight GUI + proxy that lets you visually discover and invoke your tools without hand-crafting JSON-RPC messages.

---

### 1. What Is the MCP Inspector?

* **UI**: A browser-based interface where you can browse **Tools**, **Resources**, and **Prompts**, view their schemas, and call them interactively.
* **Proxy**: A local HTTP proxy (default `localhost:6277`) that bridges the Inspector UI and your MCP server.  All traffic flows through this proxy so the UI can manage JSON-RPC sessions for you.

---

### 2. Launching the Inspector

In one terminal, start **your MCP server** (e.g. geocoding):

```bash
poetry run python app/mcp_servers/geocoding/server.py
```

Leave that running.


In a second terminal, start the Inspector:

```bash
poetry run fastmcp dev app/mcp_servers/geocoding/server.py
```

---


**To run with the POI Discovery server, use these analogous commands:**

In one terminal, start the **POI Discovery MCP server**:

```bash
poetry run python app/mcp_servers/poi_discovery/server.py
```

Leave that running.

In a second terminal, start the Inspector for the POI Discovery server:

```bash
poetry run fastmcp dev app/mcp_servers/poi_discovery/server.py
```

---


**To run with the Wikipedia server, use these analogous commands:**

In one terminal, start the **Wikipedia MCP server**:

```bash
poetry run python app/mcp_servers/wikipedia/server.py
```

Leave that running.

In a second terminal, start the Inspector for the Wikipedia server:

```bash
poetry run fastmcp dev app/mcp_servers/wikipedia/server.py
```

---




You‚Äôll see output similar to:

```
‚öôÔ∏è Proxy server listening on localhost:6277
üîë Session token: 7d1324d291d383d3569a0d0a0722efa6ddc3cfeee6655e5cd6a69479b8c0a466
   Use this token to authenticate requests or set DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH=true to disable auth

üöÄ MCP Inspector is up and running at:
   http://localhost:6274

üåê Opening browser...
```

* **Port 6274**: the Inspector UI
* **Port 6277**: the proxy that forwards UI requests to your MCP server
* **Session token**: one-time key to unlock the proxy

---

### 3. Authenticating the Inspector

By default, the proxy requires the printed **Session token**. You have two options:

#### A. Paste the token in the UI

1. In your browser, go to [http://localhost:6274](http://localhost:6274).
2. In the left-hand panel, expand **Configuration ‚Üí Authentication**.
3. Paste the token (e.g. `7d1324d291d...`) into the **Session Token** field and click **Save**.
4. Select **Transport Type ‚Üí HTTP (streamable)** and set **Target ‚Üí**

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
   ```
5. Click **Connect**.
6. The status indicator will switch from **Disconnected** ‚Üí **Connected**, and your tools will appear in the center pane.

#### B. Disable auth (dev only)

If you‚Äôre on a private machine and don‚Äôt want to deal with tokens, restart with:

```bash
DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH=true poetry run mcp dev app/mcp_servers/geocoding/server.py
```

**Or for the POI Discovery server:**

```bash
DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH=true poetry run mcp dev app/mcp_servers/poi_discovery/server.py
```


This bypasses proxy authentication entirely.

---

### 4. Using the Inspector

Once **Connected**, the Inspector UI shows:

* **Tools**: click one (e.g. `geocode_location`)
* **Schema**: input fields auto-generated from your Pydantic models
* **Call panel**: enter parameters (e.g. `location_name = Athens`)
* **Result stream**: live view of structured JSON + text content

You can experiment freely‚Äîtry edge cases, test error handling, and see progress messages in real time.

---

## 5 ¬∑ Dev Workflow

### 5.1 ¬∑ Quick Commands

```bash
# Hot-reload backend while editing
 poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Unit tests (all MCP servers)
poetry run pytest tests/unit

# Formatting / lint
poetry run black .
poetry run isort .
```

Docker services stay up; restart them only after editing a micro-server.

### 5.2 ¬∑ MCP Server Testing: Individual vs. Integration

**Individual MCP Server Testing** (Test one server in isolation):

```bash
# 1. Start the specific MCP server you want to test
poetry run python app/mcp_servers/geocoding/server.py
# OR
poetry run python app/mcp_servers/poi_discovery/server.py
# OR
poetry run python app/mcp_servers/wikipedia/server.py

# 2. In another terminal, run its integration test
poetry run pytest tests/integration/test_live_geocode.py -s
# OR
poetry run pytest tests/integration/test_live_poi_discovery.py -s
# OR
poetry run pytest tests/integration/test_live_wikipedia.py -s
```

**Full System Integration Testing** (All servers via orchestrator):

```bash
# 1. Start the full FastAPI orchestrator (which connects to all MCP servers)
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# 2. Run comprehensive system tests
poetry run pytest tests/integration/ -s
```

### 5.3 ¬∑ MCP Inspector for Visual Testing


For interactive testing and debugging of individual MCP servers:

```bash
# Start your MCP server first
poetry run python app/mcp_servers/geocoding/server.py

# Then launch the FastMCP Inspector in another terminal
poetry run fastmcp dev app/mcp_servers/geocoding/server.py
# Opens browser UI at http://localhost:6274
```

### 5.4 ¬∑ Integration Tests Details

We include end-to-end integration tests for each FastMCP server:

* **Geocoding:** `tests/integration/test_live_geocode.py`
  - Connects via streamable-HTTP to running geocoding server
  - Lists the `geocode_location` tool and prints its JSON schema
  - Invokes the tool with `"Berlin"`
  - Prints raw JSON-RPC blocks and parsed `structuredContent`
  - Asserts that `lat`, `lon`, and `display_name` are returned

* **POI Discovery:** `tests/integration/test_live_poi_discovery.py`
  - Tests `search_pois` tool with Berlin tourism query
  - Validates POI results structure and distance sorting
  - Prints complete tool schema and response data

* **Wikipedia:** `tests/integration/test_live_wikipedia.py`
  - Tests `get_wikipedia_info` tool with "Eiffel Tower" query
  - Validates Wikipedia content extraction and URL generation
  - Ensures summary, extract, and title fields are present

**Run individual integration tests:**

```bash
# Must have the specific server running first:
poetry run python app/mcp_servers/geocoding/server.py

# Then execute in another terminal:
poetry run pytest tests/integration/test_live_geocode.py -s
```

The `-s` flag disables pytest's output capture so you see all debug information, including tool schemas and response structures.






## üß™ How to Test Your MCP Agent (Health & Queries) TASK006

You can verify your MCP agent and all microservices are working with these commands:

### Health checks (all should return `{\"status\":\"ok\"}`)

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health/geocoding
curl http://localhost:8000/health/poi
curl http://localhost:8000/health/wikipedia
```

### Simple location queries (the scope of Task T006)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "Rome"}' | jq
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "Paris"}' | jq
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "Tokyo"}' | jq
```

These will test the full orchestration pipeline: geocoding, POI discovery, and Wikipedia. For best results, use simple location names as queries. Complex travel planning queries will be supported in later tasks with GPT-4o-mini integration.

#### For pretty-printed JSON output (recommended for local development):

> **Before running the curl command below, make sure you have started all MCP servers locally:**
> 
> ```bash
> poetry run python run_all_servers.py
> ```
> 
> Then, in a separate terminal, start the FastAPI orchestrator:
> 
> ```bash
> poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
> ```
> 
> Once both are running, you can test the orchestrator endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "Rome"}' | jq
```

> **Tip:** [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is a command-line JSON processor that formats and colors output for easier reading. Install it on macOS with:
> ```bash
> brew install jq
> ```
